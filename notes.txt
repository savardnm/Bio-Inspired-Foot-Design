Questions
What is our research question?
- Investigate Lice Claws as a viable source of bio inspiration (start with lice, expand)
- Use embodied intelligence as a guiding principle of mech design (embodied int --> bio insp --> lice)

focus on: EmAI, Lice, Bio-insp, ML?

Do we 'select one gripper' or is it pre-selected by lice inspiration target
i.e. is lice our main focus, or is it a 'coincidence'?

How much should I discuss the stick insect? Just as background, or should I put a section ~contract with a diagram of the proposed insect combo



--------------
last chapter:

what does this tell us compared to previous investigation

look at starting point of pad

point: what is the similarity/sense of outcome - meaning of outcome.

list how many parameter

discuss:
compare our ga to real lice solution
what can be compared between. does our simulation explain
why does it "focus" on one area.

point: start with bio
develop one example
implement technicals
ML to optimize technical
connect back to bio
how close of a solution do we reach to connect back

comparison table --> compare grippers (compare bio vs trad)
other related gripper work. somehow need to connect to other reseach. find other grippers.
ex "gripper A requires many actuators" or gripper B requires suction
compare to other state of the art. why is ours needed in the existing space
