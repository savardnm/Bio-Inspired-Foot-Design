last chapter:

what does this tell us compared to previous investigation

look at starting point of pad

point: what is the similarity/sense of outcome - meaning of outcome.

list how many parameter

discuss:
compare our ga to real lice solution
what can be compared between. does our simulation explain
why does it "focus" on one area.

point: start with bio
develop one example
implement technicals
ML to optimize technical
connect back to bio
how close of a solution do we reach to connect back

comparison table --> compare grippers (compare bio vs trad)
other related gripper work. somehow need to connect to other reseach. find other grippers.
ex "gripper A requires many actuators" or gripper B requires suction
compare to other state of the art. why is ours needed in the existing space
