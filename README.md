# Description
This is my repository for using coppeliasim to simulate grippers and accessing the simulation & results to use for Genetic Algorithm optimization

The main file being run is src/claw_ga.py - which runs the whole stack

# Requirements

## Python requirements
The programs require python to run. In addition, it requires the pip packages as recorded in the requirements.txt file, which can be installed as:

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

## CoppeliaSim Environment
The program requires CoppeliaSim to run the simulations.

CoppeliaSim can be downloaded from the [CoppeliaSim Website](https://www.coppeliarobotics.com/#)
